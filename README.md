# adventure-platforming-game
This is a small proof-of-concept game I build using the Game Maker Studio 2 and the Game Maker Language. 

The Project can be run using on Windows by downloading the **AdventurePlatformerWindows.zip**, extracting the files, and running **AdventurePlatoformer.exe**. Alternatively, you can play a web version of the game here (you may need to zoom out the window): https://bradpeng.ca/adventureplatformer/game.html
